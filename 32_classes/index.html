	<p>Picture a game with a monster.</p>
	<p>Monster can do different things using methods, eg attack, roar etc</p>
	<p>If say you want to create 20 or 100 different monsters, you do not want to go through the repetitive process of creating the monster, naming it and assigning methods.</p>
	<p>Enter Object Orientation.</p>
	<p>Create a blue print (class) that represents a basic monster, then adjust it based on the different qualities of each individual monster.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Class is a blueprint of a type of object.</li>
	<li>Instance  of a class is an object created by using the blueprints of the class.</li>
	<li>To create shared methods between instances, use the prototype object.</li>
	</ol>

			//Monster class
			//constructor method executed each time we create a new instance of monster class
			var Monster = function() {
				console.log('a new monster is being created');
				//Math.random is a number between 0 and 1
				this.energy = Math.random() * 100;

				//this would create the method every time a monster is instantiated.
				//better to just create a method and have all monsters share it

				/*this.roar = function() {
					console.log('RRROAARR');

			};

			//Better to have a method that all monsters can share if it is something common to all of them. They all roar
			Monster.prototype.roar = function() {
				console.log('RRROAARR');

				//this.energy = this.energy * 2;
				this.energy *=  2;
